### **2. Enhanced Organization Selector**
- **Visual organization list**: Shows all organizations with roles and join dates
- **Current organization indicator**: Highlights the active organization
- **Role badges**: Color-coded role indicators for each organization
- **Join date display**: Shows when user joined each organization

### **3. Organization Switcher Component**

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Database Migration**
```sql
-- Key changes in migration:

## ðŸ”’ Security & Permissions

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Per-organization roles**: Different roles in different organizations
- **Permission inheritance**: Role permissions maintained per organization
- **Data isolation**: Organization data properly isolated
- **Secure switching**: Validated organization membership

### **Database Security**
- **RLS policies**: Row-level security for multi-organization access
- **Function security**: SECURITY DEFINER functions for safe operations
- **Audit trails**: All organization switches are logged
- **Permission validation**: Ensures users can only access their organizations

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### **Scenario 1: User with Multiple Organizations**
```
User: john@example.com
Organizations:
- Acme Corp (Owner)
- Tech Startup (Employee) 
- Consulting Firm (Admin)

Current: Acme Corp (Owner)
â†’ Can switch to Tech Startup (Employee) or Consulting Firm (Admin)
â†’ Role and permissions change based on selected organization
```

### **Scenario 2: Organization Switching**
```
1. User is in "Acme Corp" as Owner
2. Clicks organization switcher in header
3. Selects "Tech Startup" from dropdown
4. System switches to Tech Startup context
5. User now has Employee role in Tech Startup
6. All data and permissions updated accordingly
```

### **Scenario 3: New Organization Joining**
```
1. User receives invite code for new organization
2. Uses invite code to join organization
3. New organization appears in organization selector
4. User can switch to new organization
5. Role and permissions set based on invite
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimizations

### **Database Optimizations**

4. **Switching errors**: Check database connectivity and permissions

### **Debugging Steps**
1. **Check user memberships**: Verify user is member of organization
2. **Verify role assignment**: Ensure role is properly assigned
3. **Check database functions**: Verify switching functions are working
4. **Review RLS policies**: Ensure policies allow multi-organization access
