### **2. Enhanced SimpleOrgSwitch Component**
- **Location**: `src/components/dashboard/shared/SimpleOrgSwitch.tsx`
- **Enhancement**: Integrated JoinOrganizationButton into the organization switcher dropdown

- **Member count**: See how many members each organization has
- **Organization details**: View name, description, creation date, and logo

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **JoinOrganizationButton Props**
```typescript
interface JoinOrganizationButtonProps {
  onOrganizationJoined: (org: Organization) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

### **Organization Discovery Query**
```typescript
// Get organizations the user is not already a member of
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("organizations")
  .select(`
    id,
    name,
    description,
    logo_url,
    created_at,
    organization_members(count)
  `)
  .not("id", "in", `(${userOrgIds.join(",")})`)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

### **Join Process Logic**
```typescript
// Check for pending invitations first
const { data: invite } = await supabase
  .from("org_invites")
  .select("id, role")
  .eq("organization_id", org.id)
  .eq("email", user.user.email)
  .eq("status", "pending")
  .single();

if (invite) {
  // Accept invitation
  await supabase.from("organization_members").insert({
    user_id: user.user.id,
    organization_id: org.id,
    role: invite.role,
    last_selected: false,
  });
} else {
  // Send join request
  await supabase.from("org_invites").insert({
    organization_id: org.id,
    email: user.user.email,
    role: "employee",
    status: "pending",
  });
}
```
